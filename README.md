#Women Who Code - iOS application

We're creating a mentorship matching application for the non-profit, Women Who Code, which will help match students and potential mentees with developers. The basic functionality of this app will include allowing users to create profiles, suggesting possible mentees/mentors for that user, and then facilitating that mentorship relationship via messaging.

Parse powers our backend.

Version 2 might include tracking WWC events in your area, ability to donate to Women Who Code, and Github authentication. 

For benchmarking applications, we decided to go with different dating apps, as the basic model of creating detailed profiles and then matching people based on those characteristics is very similar to what we're trying to achieve with this WWC app. 

Benchmarking Applications:
1) OkCupid
2) How About We

General Guideline for the app, as layed out by Nathan & Alaina (from WWC):
